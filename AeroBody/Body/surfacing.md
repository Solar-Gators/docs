# Surfacing in Solidworks
## Overview
We currently use surfaces in Solidworks to design the body of the solar car. Because the CAD class at UF only teaches solids in Solidworks, new members have to be taught how to use surfaces. After taking a less-structured approach for a few years, the team has recently developed a course for training new members on using surfaces. Through a series of exercises, new members become comfortable with surfacing commands while also learning the design philosophy behind the solar car body. 

Many of these exercises are drawn from tutorial videos on YouTube; for each one, we have identified what commands we expect members to have used and in what ways, with the goal of members becoming comfortable using those commands by doing the exercise. Additionally, members are encouraged to not just follow the tutorial, but to add something of their own, to show true understanding of the commands.

The last part of the course delves into the theory behind solar car design, with readings assigned to teach members basic elements of design, such as types of drag, canopy style and position, and the influences of details such as fillets. This last part also sees the exercises branching out into designing actual solar car bodies, without using tutorials. By this point, it is expected that members have become fluent with most surfacing commands, solidifying their knowledge by using them on their own original designs.

Throughout the course, it is essential that the subteam lead(s)/PM give detailed feedback to members on their designs. Currently, leads have been meeting before the regular meetings to go over designs and prepare critiques for the meeting.
