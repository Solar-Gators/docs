## Research
Our team is constantly striving to improve the manufacturing process for our body shell. 

Our team keeps a living document listing our accumulated knowledge of CFRP design and manufaturing [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uGxO3vvojlvQpSgR5dS56Txpcz5Pz4Pb0ibyC_m-AOc/edit?usp=sharing).
Mechanical and Aerobody are also looking into the possiblity of designing/manufacturing a CFRP monocoque chassis for our next car. We are maintaining our documentation of ongoing research [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11V-ra_Ib-YNE7QJFS8tzUHOf9T9uZZwOtS5GQ0hQf38/edit?usp=sharing).
