## Research

* We have a [living document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uGxO3vvojlvQpSgR5dS56Txpcz5Pz4Pb0ibyC_m-AOc/edit?usp=sharing) listing our accumulated knowledge of CFRP design and manufaturing
* We have [documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11V-ra_Ib-YNE7QJFS8tzUHOf9T9uZZwOtS5GQ0hQf38/edit?usp=sharing) for the Aerobody and Mechanical systems' research on designing and manufacturing a CFRP monocoque chassis.
