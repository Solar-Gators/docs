## Repositories
Altium schematics, like software, are stored in the organization's GitHub heres how to do that.
### Naming:
For PCBs the naming convention is carName-PLATFORM-systemName-PCB (ex. cielo-STM32F0-telemetry). Cars will often reuse improved versions of previous PCBs; however, please make a new repository when working for a new car that way we can easily distigush what is used where.  
1. Make sure you are a member of the [Solar-Gators GitHub organization](https://github.com/Solar-Gators).
