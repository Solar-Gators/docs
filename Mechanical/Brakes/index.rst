Brakes
====

Overview
-----------

The Brakes subsystem is one of the most critical when it comes to the safety of the driver and the solar car. It’s primary objectives are:
  * Perform calculations to ensure the solar car will have the required retarding force to stop at half a “g” (9.8 ) of deceleration.
  * Develop a lightweight, reliable, stopping mechanism (typically hydraulic brakes) for the solar car. This includes the pedal assembly/caliper mounts/master cylinder mounts/etc.
  * Develop a parking brake for solar car
  * If deemed necessary, integrate the activation of the motor regen brakes into the overall brakes system

The brakes subsystems can be broken down into the following components/concepts:
