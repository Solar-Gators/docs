Power Board

From `actpower.com <https://www.actpower.com/educational/what-is-a-power-supply-and-how-does-it-work/>`_, 
"The power supply works to convert the power from the source into the correct format and voltage." 
The car has two power sources: the solar cells charging a 100V battery and a 12V supplemental battery. 
Thus the power board has to manage those two sources while supplying power to other systems whose components 
only need maybe 5V. Most of the other systems have to be powered through the power board PCB which is why 
it is so important.

Currently we only have the summary from last year but soon more resources detailing the power board system 
will be put out.
