Power Board

Functionality of the Board
====
Our powerboard serves to step down the 100V supplied from the car's battery to lower voltages, allowing other electrical subsystems to utilize the voltages that they need as an input. The board takes in voltage inputs from the battery pack and the solar array at 100V and 12V. These voltages are then filtered out through the board and stepped down to 12V, 5V and 3.3V. The board also establishes the multiple power states of the car in terms of the trip state and the main state.
