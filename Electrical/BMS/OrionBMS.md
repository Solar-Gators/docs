# Overview of the Orion BMS 2
The Orion BMS is a pre-manufactured device that can be purchased, which manages the battery pack through the use of: 1 hall-effect current sensor, 8 temperature sensors in the form of thermistors, individual cell voltage taps, an isolation sensor, and a full pack voltage tap. The voltage sensors need to be precise, which is why one is given to each cell. On the other, hand, we can use only up to 8 thermistors, just to get an idea of the average temperature within the battery pack. Isolation is incredibly important in high voltage applications. We want to ensure that the voltage carried through the vehicle's wires and battery doesn't come to harm the user. To do so, an isolation sensor is used to measure the electrical isolation between the chassis (technically the Orion uses ground, but same difference) and the battery pack. 

### Documentation
This page will be updated frequently with more detail on the nooks and crannies of the Orion BMS. But as an EE/CE student, get in the habit of checking documentation, it'll be useful for your future classes and career. Below is some documentation on how the Orion works.
