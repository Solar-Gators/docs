# Hardware Development Guide
**Please Read the ClickUp guide first as this document will heavily rely on knowledge shared there.**
## Repositories
Altium schematics, like software, are stored in the organization's GitHub heres how to do that.
### Naming:
For PCBs the naming convention is carName-subname-PCB (ex. cielo-telemetry-PCB, cielo-lights-PCB). Cars will often reuse improved versions of previous PCBs; however, please make a new repository when working for a new car that way we can easily distigush what is used where.  
**To add a new altium project to git**
1. Make sure you are a member of the [Solar-Gators GitHub organization](https://github.com/Solar-Gators).
2. Create navigate to your existing project. **Note:** How to make an altium project can be found [here](https://example.com/) TODO.
3. Open git bash, command prompt (Windows) or terminal (OSX) and run `git init`
4. Create a new repository by clicking on the new repository button.
![Create Repository](/_static/processes/new_repo_button.png)
5. Following the naming convention give the repository a name and a breif description do not add a git ignore or readme.
6. Create the repository.
7. On the page following the "â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line" instructions go to git bash and type those lines.
![Push Repository](/_static/processes/set_upstream.png)
8. Now that you have set the remote repository for your project it is time to add a .gitignore. The easiest way to do this is make a text file and rename it (including the .txt extension) to .gitignore
9. A great tool for making .gitingore is [here](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore) type altium hit create and copy the output.
10. Open up your .gitignore file and paste the output.
11. In git bash type `git add .gitignore` this will stage the git ignore file for commit.
12. In git bash type `git commit -a -m "Added git ignore"` this will commit the git ignore file.
13. In git bash type `git add .` this will add all files and stage them to be commited (Except those in the git ignore).
14. In git bash type `git commit -a -m "First commit"` this will add all your files to the repository.
15. In git bash type `git push` this will update the remote repository with all your changes.

**Other Notes**
Make sure that a proper .gitignore file is made for any new repository.
When PCBs are manufactured make sure to tag the commit that was used!
