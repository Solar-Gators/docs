Auxiliary
=========

During the competition, it is important to be able to communicate what you're doing to other drivers, just like you would when driving any other car. 
The auxiliary team takes care of these functions, which include lights and the horn. 
One of the aux boards serves as the driver's control panel, so it has buttons and switches for other functionality, like cruise control, in addition to controls for the aux functionality.
