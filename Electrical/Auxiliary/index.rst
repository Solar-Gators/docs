Auxiliary
=========

During the competition, it is important to be able to communicate what you're doing to other drivers, just like you would when driving any other car. 
This communication happens mainly through the use of lights and the horn. 
The auxiliary team's role is to ensure that the car has this functionality and that the driver has easy access to it.

Auxiliary is responsible for two main systems:
