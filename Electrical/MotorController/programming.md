# Setting a Profile  

##  **Before Programming:**

1. Make sure you have Mitsuba Configuration Tool
2. Get a USB Type B Mini
3. Identify the correct COM port before attempting to program
	1. Plug into the controller 
	2. Go to device manager and check which COM port is being used 
	3. Set the COM port in the Mitsuba Configuration Tool  

##  **Programming:**

1. Use file access options to either save a controller configuration or to load a previously saved controller configuration
2. Use controller access to set the COM port you previously identified. This section also contains the write and read options. 
	1. To load the settings that are currently on the controller use the read option. 
	2. To upload a new controller congifuration use the write option. Be warned, writing to the Mitsuba does take a while (sometime a couple minutes)
	3. Since writing takes a long time, make sure no one turns off the car so you dont have to redo the writing process from the start
3. Click End and close the tool when writing is completed
