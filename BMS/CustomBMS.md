# What is Custom BMS?

Currently, our team uses the Orion BMS system, and while it performs its function well, it can be expensive. We're working on developing a Custom BMS as a cheaper alternative that meets our needs, and it's fun!

## Development Software
When working on developing a PCB which will meet our development needs, we use KiCad, a free and easy to use tool.
