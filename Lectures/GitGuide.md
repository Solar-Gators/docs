## Creating an account and joining the organization

First step should be to create a [Github](https://github.com/) account and get added to the Solar Gators github organization

To be added to the Solar Gators github organization, you need to send the electrical project manager (@Samuel Cuervo) an private message on the Solar Gators' slack page with your Github account username. When I see the message, I will add people as soon as possible. You will then receive a email that you must accept within 7 days to officially join the organization.

## Downloading Git and (Python, if you are developing on the Docs website)

After you have created an account and you're in the organization, you must download [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and if you are developing on the readthedocs website, [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Below, I briefly mention an alternative with a easy to use GUI called [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
